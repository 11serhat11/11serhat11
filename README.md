I'm Serhat from Turkey. I'm currently studying Computer Science at Gazi University in Ankara. I really enjoy playing video games and learning new techniques and technologies about them. I also made some game project as game developer since I like to do my own game :) I'm also into AI and Machine Learning. ChatGPT, Midjourney, DALL-E and more... They all made our lives easier. I don't want to fall behind from this new world. That's why I also learn and work on ML. 

Skills: C# / C / UNITY / JAVA / HTML / CSS / PYTHON
